#### Math and Coding Goal
* Everyone CAN edit a PreTeXt
* At least one commit to the Gröbner basis chapter
 * CONTENT: undergrad project + exercises & examples
#### Math and professional
* Everyone CAN add to Zotero collection 
 * Use the chrome add-on
* Add export to bibTeX
#### Math and CS Theory
Understand some *key algorithms* below:
* BUCH BERGER
 * (DA for multivariable)
* Intersection of Ideals
* Radical of Ideal (improve)
 * Show that this algorithm is more effective in a Gröbner Basis
* Invariants of Diagonal Action (skew setting)
* Hilbert Ideal via. subspace arrangement (skew setting)
