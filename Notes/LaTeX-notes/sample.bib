	abstract = {J. Kung and G.-C. Rota, in their 1984 paper, write: “Like the Arabian phoenix rising out of its ashes, the theory of invariants, pronounced dead at the turn of the century, is once again at the forefront of mathematics”. The book of Sturmfels is both an easy-to-read textbook for invariant theory and a challenging research monograph that introduces a new approach to the algorithmic side of invariant theory. The Groebner bases method is the main tool by which the central problems in invariant theory become amenable to algorithmic solutions. Students will find the book an easy introduction to this “classical and new” area of mathematics. Researchers in mathematics, symbolic computation, and computer science will get access to a wealth of research ideas, hints for applications, outlines and details of algorithms, worked out examples, and research problems.},

Schmid, Domokos, and Hegedu\&\#x030B;s sharpened Noether's bound when G is not cyclic and char F=0. We prove that the sharpened bound holds over general fields: If G is not cyclic and {\textbar}G{\textbar} is invertible in F, then the ring of invariants is generated by elements of degree at most 34·{\textbar}G{\textbar} if {\textbar}G{\textbar} is even, and at most 58·{\textbar}G{\textbar} if {\textbar}G{\textbar} is odd.},

We also give a formula for the Hilbert series of a product J of the linear ideals without any assumptions on the subspace arrangement. It turns out that the Hilbert series of J is a combinatorial invariant of the subspace arrangement: it only depends on the intersection lattice and the dimension function. The graded Betti numbers of J are determined by the Hilbert series, so they are combinatorial invariants as well. The results can be applied to Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA), a tool that is useful for computer vision and image processing.},
