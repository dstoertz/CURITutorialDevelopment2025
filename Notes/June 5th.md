Inti is here and we're talking about Macaulay2—and the programmatic aspects of it. Allows us to contribute to open source, "if you're really into tech or math it's good i guess."

Gandini also went on about the standing desk. We can put 2 oreos on the standing desk, and it'll be very exciting. 

#### Quick Check-in
##### Sasha
* Sasha had her class—talked about the opening symposium
* We should do a quick powerpoint if possible. All the CURI groups have to register for it *but only one person has to register.*
* Because it's four of us, it might take ~10min. 
* *Request:* go to Sasha's class on Tuesday at 11AM
 * We give a presentation and then get feedback.
##### Gordie
* Got a lot more PreTeXt done
 * Deployed GitHub pages
 * Got codespaces working better for PreTeXt
 * Got local PreTeXt working as well
 * Read through the PreTeXt textbook and understand general document formatting
 * Created a PreTeXt demo to practice setting a PreTeXt environment independent of the template provided by Gandini for practice & understanding.
* Got Macaulay2 downloaded
 * Practiced with basic Macaulay2 syntax
 * Got emacs installed on the local machine
 * Started relating the commands in M2 to stuff in research document
* Read through a bunch of the textbook materials
 * Read through first 2 chapters of the invariant theory textbook and did some of the example proofs
 * Read through the Invariant Theory document written by Gandini again to understand the material better
 * Read a little about Grobner Basis online for a bit.
##### Sam
* Tried to understand Grobner Basis
 * Read some of the Gandini book--read through chapter 2 completely and a bit of 4
 * Dirksen and Kemper as well (constructive invariant theory)--in the google drive. 
 * Look at Grobner Basis.pdf
##### Marcus
* Marcus got VSCode set up with PreTeXt
 * Everything is compiling and doing it's stuff really well.
 * Has his browser set up with PreText as well. 
* Wrote the introduction to the book. 
* **Note:** *Sam should add everyone to the repo*
* Marcus spent too much time on PreTeXt local, but it is ok, and now he'll record what he did so future people are not so confused. 
### Moving Forward
* We all got M2 codespace set up on the cloud
 * Marcus and gordie got it working. 
 * Sam also has it working
 * Sasha is doing sasha
Here's a joke: what do you call a pig that has legs? ... josh.
